        <h1>Wind Energy</h1>
        <p>
            Wind energy is generated using turbines that convert kinetic energy from the wind into electricity.

        <ol>
            <li>Technologies:</li>
            <li>Horizontal and vertical axis turbine designs.</li>
            <li>Advanced turbines with larger blades and better aerodynamics for higher efficiency.</li>
            <li>Offshore vs. Onshore:</li>
            <li>Onshore: Easier to install but may face land-use conflicts.</li>
            <li>Offshore: Benefits from stronger, more consistent winds but involves higher costs and technical challenges.</li>
