            <li>Types of Plants:</li>
            <li>Large-Scale: Dams like Chinaâ€™s Three Gorges Dam produce massive energy but can displace communities and disrupt ecosystems.</li>
            <li>Small-Scale: Localized projects provide power without significant environmental impact.</li>
            <li>Run-of-the-River: Generate energy without storing large amounts of water, minimizing ecological damage.</li>
