        Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on building algorithms that can learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. Unlike traditional programming, where the rules are explicitly written by programmers, ML systems improve their performance as they are exposed to more data.

            Supervised Learning: The model is trained on labeled data (data with known outcomes) to learn the mapping between inputs and outputs. For example, predicting house prices based on historical data.
        </li>
        <li>
            Unsupervised Learning: The model is given data without labels and must identify patterns or structures within the data, such as clustering similar customers together.
        </li>
        <li>
            Reinforcement Learning: The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.
