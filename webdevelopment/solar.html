        <h1>Solar Energy</h1>
        <p>
            Solar energy harnesses sunlight and converts it into electricity using photovoltaic (PV) cells or concentrated solar power (CSP) systems.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Types of Systems:</li>
            <li>On-Grid: Connected to the utility grid, allowing excess power to be fed back to the grid.</li>
            <li>Off-Grid: Independent systems with battery storage for areas without grid access.</li>
            <li>Hybrid Systems: Combine solar with other energy sources, often including battery storage.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Emerging uses include solar-powered vehicles, portable chargers, and even clothing with embedded solar cells.
